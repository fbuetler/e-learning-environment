With the introduction of Lehrplan 21, Computer Science became an integral part of the Swiss education curriculum. To cover the new need for teaching material about Computer Science, the Education and Counselling Center for Computer Science Education at ETH ZÃ¼rich has published the text book series ''einfach Informatik''. 
This thesis covers the implementation of a computer-based learning environment for pupils at the third and fourth grade level to teach concepts of Computer Science with exercises introduced in the text book ''einfach Informatik 3/4''.
