\section{Vue.js}

Vue.js is developed by a company, but by Evan You and was first published in 2014. It is an alternative to Angular and React and was supossed to be a lightweight version of Angular. Vue.js is also based on reusable components, each having its own HTML, Javascript and CSS \cite{Vue}.

\section{TypeScript}

JavaScript had its publication in 1996, is a scripting language and is intended to be used in browser to extend the possibilities of HTML and CSS. It can dynamically manipulate HTML and CSS, validate user data, send and receive data without reloading the page and much more.
TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types and can be used anywhere JavaScript runs, because TypeScript code is transformed to JavaScript code by the TypeScript compiler. It provides a way to describe what type a variable has and helps to catch errors before the code is run. Moreover, TypeScript adds among others the concept of method signatures, type interference, interfaces, enummerations and tuples. \cite{Typescript}.
