I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to \textit{Prof. Dr. Juraj Hromkovic} for giving me the opportunity to carry out my bachelor thesis about creating a computer-based learning environment for pupils at the third and fourth grade, that also helped me to learn so many new things.

I am extremely thankful for the huge amount of feedback I received from \textit{Regula Lacher}, \textit{Jacqueline Staub}, \textit{Giovanni Serafini} and \textit{Urs Wildeisen} about my thesis. This really helped me to create a satisfying result. 

I am also grateful to my parents for their love and support throughout my life. I very much appreciate the opportunities and experiences they gave me that have made me who I am.

Many thanks to my proofreaders \textit{Uchendu Nwachukwu} and \textit{Lasse Meinen} for giving constructive criticism about this thesis.
